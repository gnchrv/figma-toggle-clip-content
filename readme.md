# Toggle Clip Content

![Plugin Cover](assets/plugin-cover.png)

This is a simple Figma plugin that allows to toggle elements clipping modes from the keyboard. Simply add a shortcut in macOS Preferences.

Previously, this command was available in the menu bar and could have a configurable shortcut. Now, the command is missing and there’s no way to toggle an element’s clipping mode from the keyboard. This plugin brings this option back.
